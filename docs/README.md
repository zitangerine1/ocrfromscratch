# Hmm... What's This?

This is a OCR - optical character recognition engine built on Python. It has the capability to input an entire multi-line text document and separate line-from-line. 

This program has (TBD) main components:
- SegmentPage
- BatchPadSeg
- ModelTest
- CRNN

This is subject to change as I may split the files in the future for ease of reading.
